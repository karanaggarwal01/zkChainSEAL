                  ForensicLedger is a blockchain-based platform designed for
                  secure management, verification, and tracking of digital
                  forensic evidence. It ensures the integrity and chain of
                  custody of evidence through cryptographic verification and
                  immutable record-keeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The platform works by creating cryptographic hashes of
                  evidence files and recording these hashes on a blockchain
                  ledger, allowing for tamper-evident storage and verification.
                  Each access or transfer of evidence is recorded, creating a
                  complete and verifiable chain of custody.

                <p className="mb-2">
                  Blockchain technology ensures evidence integrity through
                  several mechanisms:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is recorded on the
                    blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted without
                    detection.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cryptographic Verification:</strong> Evidence files
                    are hashed using secure algorithms, and these hashes are
                    stored on the blockchain. Any change to the original file
                    would result in a different hash, immediately flagging
                    tampering.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Distributed Consensus:</strong> Multiple nodes
                    verify and agree on the state of the ledger, making it
                    extremely difficult to manipulate records.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Timestamping:</strong> All actions are timestamped
                    and recorded in chronological order, providing a verifiable
                    timeline of evidence handling.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These features combine to create a system where evidence
                  integrity can be mathematically verified, significantly
                  strengthening the admissibility and reliability of digital
                  evidence in court.
